# My Work

- Thanks for taking a look at my code! I completed the challenge requirements, along with one stretch goal. At a high level, my addition was creating a database table for reviews. A review belongs to both a user, and a book. There's always room to add more tests, but hopefully what I have here includes detailed-enough tests.

- Reach out with any questions that come up. Happy to provide a more detailed breakdown of my overall approach. Thank you, again!
